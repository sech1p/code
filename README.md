‚ö†Ô∏è Notice: Be prepared that you need a better computer if you decide to install all extensions from extensions.txt.

Just type in terminal:

First, in administrator mode in PowerShell type:

PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Next, run PowerShell again, and type:

For `settings.json` installation, just open settings file from Command Palette in VS Code and copy-paste my file.

**A:** In fact, I don't really need 4894254982024 extensions for example. Despites number of installed extensions currently almost reached 100 extensions (93 extensions while I'm writing this FAQ). But in this beautiful number of 100, every useful extensions:

- programming languages support
- theme
- some fun plugins like duck cursor
- rainbow indents
- AI completion
- color pickers
- workspaces
- test runners
- WakaTime
- CodeStats
- etc.
